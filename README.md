# Classification-of-Skin-Disease

The project scope is to build a way to help people to easily classify/detect their skin disease in their time of need. By creating an AI based android application platform which can help them in classifying their skin disease or at-least letting them know about the skin problem theyâ€™re facing without visiting the dermatologist in the rush hours. Using the camera (webcam) and the developed android application, we can help the users in many ways. This FYP gives the solution for detecting 3 skin diseases ie: Acne, Melanoma, Eczema. Skin diseases are hazardous and often contagious, especially melanoma, eczema, and acne. These skin diseases can be cured if detected early. The fundamental problem with it is, only an expert dermatologist is able to detect and classify such disease.
